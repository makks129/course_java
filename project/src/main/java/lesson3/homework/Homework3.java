/**
 * Finding Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
 * <p>
 * The greatest common divisor of two integers 4 and 2 is 2. The greatest common divisor of two integers 16 and 24 is 8.
 * How do you find the greatest common divisor? Let the two input integers be n1 and n2. You know that number 1 is a
 * common divisor, but it may not be the greatest common divisor. So, you can check whether k (for k = 2, 3, 4, and so on)
 * is a com- mon divisor for n1 and n2, until k is greater than n1 or n2. Store the common divisor in a variable named gcd.
 * Initially, gcd is 1. Whenever a new common divisor is found, it becomes the new gcd. When you have checked all the
 * possible common divisors from 2 up to n1 or n2, the value in variable gcd is the greatest common divisor.
